# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, acting as a **blueprint or skeleton** for a website or application. It shows the basic layout, placement of elements, and navigation flow **without focusing on colors, fonts, or images**.

## Importance of Wireframing
- **Clarifies Ideas:** Translates abstract concepts into visual layouts.
- **Facilitates Communication:** Ensures designers, developers, and stakeholders understand the structure.
- **Identifies Usability Issues:** Reveals potential navigation and interaction problems early.
- **Saves Time and Resources:** Easier to fix issues in a wireframe than in a full design or coded product.
- **Enables Easy Modifications:** Flexible for experimenting with layout and structure.
- **Guides Design and Development:** Acts as a reference for the next stages of UI/UX design.
